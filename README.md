# Trivial PortForward GUI for Windows

This is a really old fork of http://www.quantumg.net/portforward.php with fixes and the addition of a tray icon, so that you know it's running when it's minimized.

It is/was compiled with VS6.

For me, for as old as it is, it still works well enough to not search for a replacement.
